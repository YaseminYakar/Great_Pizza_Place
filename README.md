# Great_Pizza_Place

Youâ€™re to create an executable file and create a pizza place in Linux.
Users will have a GUI-like view of the pizza place. 
Customers should be able to choose a pizza size, toppings, select either carryout or delivery, 
    see the order summary (including all selections above, subtotal, taxes, and grand total) and finally place the order. 
This is expected to be a smooth experience for customers. 
You are expected to use functions, arrays, loops, conditionals (e.g. if statements, switch case statements), variables, and commands seen in class. 
Be creative and innovative. Impress your classmates and your instructor. 
Create something beautiful that you can proudly show employers and peers.
